# Deekshya - An Initiation

Our idea starts from an experience where my(Laxman) uncle had to amputate his leg due to an accident while mountain climbing and a friend's parent had to do bypass surgery on his heart. They both needed fresh blood not stored in the blood banks during that time. The only medium to ask people to donate blood was personal contacts or social media campaigns. I donated blood to my friend's parents, but due to rh-incompatibility and blood restoring period, I couldn't help my uncle. Luckily, few people raised from Social Media agreed to donate.

So, I strucked with a solution focusing on the same situation that might occur shortly. Our idea works on a real-time basis. Suppose the receiver themself or people ask for help. In that case, our idea implementor gets a real-time notification by calculating his compatibility using our algorithms. Once there are enough receivers, i.e., as per requirement, the request gets closed. 

Summarily, it helps on impacting SDG 3,4,5,9 with a single solution. It's in the health-fintech category.
